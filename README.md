# Fun
A set of well known problems that covers different aspects. Most of the problems are written in python, you will also find some in C++ or Java but I tried to code in a way to keep things simple.
You'll find a solution for:
- the longest common substring
- strongly connected components
- Kruskal and Prim
- The longest common substring
- Boruvka Algorithm
- Matrix chain multiplication (dynamic programming)
- and others 

Some of the problems are commented in french (sorry it was for a class) and some are commented in english. You can study the problems with the well known CLRS or online materials
